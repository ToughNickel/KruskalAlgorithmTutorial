#KruskalAlgorithmTutorial

This Branch contains the C OpenGL code for the Kruskal Algorithm Tutorial. 
The installation instructions are given in the [file](How_to_setup.txt).
The image texture mapping procedure has been simplified using the Simple OpenGL Image Library(SOIL). 
The library can be found here : [SOIL](http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html)
